## Note
One module is intentionally left out from this code:
* musicfetch.py - I'm unsure if this API is really meant for mass hits, so for now, I'm leaving out my code to slightly ease up on that.
This affects ytmusic.py. You can mock up a musicfetch.py yourself that returns None for all its functions, and things will work without erroring.
